## Music Exploration Using SpotifyR

In this blog I will demonstrate how I used the R programming language and the spotifyr package to compare music across the decades. Special thanks to Charlie Thompson for creating [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/).

### Step 1: Get Your Spotify Credentials

To get your Spotify credentials, you need to create a Spotify developer account and set up an app [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications).

From there, you will get your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`. Make note of these, as they will be needed in your code soon. Also, make sure to set your app's **Redirect URI** to `http://localhost:1410/`. Certain functions in the `spotifyr` package require you to be logged in as a Spotify user, and this allows you to do that. Now that we're all setup in Spotify, let's start working in R. Lastly, you will need your numeric username, which can be found [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/overview/).

### Step 2: Load Your Libraries
The libraries needed for this project are listed below. If you don't already have them, you can install them with `install.packages()`:

```
library(spotifyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggridges)
library(plotly)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(httr)
library(corrplot)
```

### Step 3: Connect R to the Spotify API

This is where your **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** are needed, as well as your username. Replace the x's below with your credentials.

```
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")
username <- "xxxxxxxxxx"
access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

## Step 4: The Fun Stuff

Now that we're connected to the Spotify API, we can start digging into the data. The `get_user_playlists()` function returns all the playlists in your Spotify library. I filtered to the decades playlists and then used the `get_playlist_tracks` function to return the songs in each playlist, and the `get_track_audio_features()` function to get details about each song. Then I combined all songs into a dataframe, called **tracklist**.

```
## Decades
my_playlists <- get_user_playlists(username)

playlists <- my_playlists %>%
  filter(name %in% c('Today\'s Top Hits',
                     'All Out 10s', 'All Out 00s',
                     'All Out 90s', 'All Out 80s',
                     'All Out 70s', 'All Out 60s'))

## Create tracklist of songs in playlists
tracklist <- list()

for(i in 1:nrow(playlists)) {
  tracks1 <- map_dfr(playlists$id[i], get_playlist_tracks)
  tracks1$playlist_name <- playlists$name[i]
  tracks1$playlist_id <- playlists$id[i]
  tracks2 <- map_dfr(tracks1$track.id, get_track_audio_features)
  tracks <- inner_join(tracks1, tracks2, by = c("track.id" = "id"))
  tracks <- inner_join(tracks, playlists, by = c("playlist_name" = "name",
                                                 "playlist_id" = "id"))
  tracklist[[i]] <- tracks
}

tracklist <- do.call(rbind, tracklist)
```

Now that we have our tracklist, we'll use the `mutate()` and `case_when()` functions to add another column. The `pnum` column will be used to chronologically sort our tracklist by decade.

```
tracklist <- tracklist %>% 
mutate(pnum = 
  case_when(playlist_name == 'Today\'s Top Hits' ~ 7,
            playlist_name == 'All Out 10s' ~ 6,
            playlist_name == 'All Out 00s' ~ 5,
            playlist_name == 'All Out 90s' ~ 4,
            playlist_name == 'All Out 80s' ~ 3,
            playlist_name == 'All Out 70s' ~ 2, 
            playlist_name == 'All Out 60s' ~ 1
            )
) %>% arrange(pnum)
```

The last step before we start plotting is to create some features. The [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) goes into more detail about what each of these track features mean. For our project, we'll just use the averages of each.
```
# Get feature means
tracks_avg <- tracklist %>%
  select(playlist_name, danceability, energy, 
         loudness, speechiness, acousticness,
         instrumentalness, liveness, valence, 
         tempo, duration_ms, track.popularity) %>%
  group_by(playlist_name) %>%
  summarise(danceability = mean(danceability),
            energy = mean(energy),
            loudness = mean(loudness),
            speechiness = mean(speechiness),
            acousticness = mean(acousticness),
            instrumentalness = mean(instrumentalness),
            liveness = mean(liveness),
            valence = mean(valence),
            tempo = mean(tempo),
            duration_ms = mean(duration_ms),
            track.popularity = mean(track.popularity)) 
```
Now that our features are ready to go, it's time to get plotting. We'll start by plotting danceability using `ggplot2` and `ggridges` to see how the danceability of music varies across the different decade playlists.

```
# Danceability
g1 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = danceability, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(danceability)), linetype = "dashed")
```

![danceability](https://github.com/matthewpaley/Spotify/blob/master/images/danceability.png)

Right away we can see a trend. Music has been increasing in danceability pretty steadily each decade. I wonder what trends we can with the other features? 

```
# Energy
g2 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = energy, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(energy)), linetype = "dashed")

# Loudness
g3 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = loudness, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(loudness)), linetype = "dashed")

# Speechiness
g4 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = speechiness, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  xlim(0.01,0.075) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(speechiness)), linetype = "dashed")

# Acousticness
g5 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = acousticness, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(acousticness)), linetype = "dashed")

# Instrumentalness
g6 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = instrumentalness, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  xlim(0,.00002) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(instrumentalness)), linetype = "dashed")

# Liveness
g7 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = liveness, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  xlim(0,0.3) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(liveness)), linetype = "dashed")

# Valence
g8 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = valence, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(valence)), linetype = "dashed")

# Tempo
g9 <- ggplot(tracklist, aes(x = tempo, 
                            y = fct_reorder(playlist_name, pnum), 
                            fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(tempo)), linetype = "dashed")
```

Once all plots have been created, we can combine them together to get the full picture.

```
# Combine all plots into one
plot <- ggarrange(g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6, g7, g8, g9) 
title <- expression(atop("Comparing the Decades", 
                         atop(italic("How Music has Changed Over Time"), "")))

# Add title, subtitle, and axis title
plot <- annotate_figure(plot,
                        top = text_grob(title, size = 18),
                        bottom = text_grob("Created by Matthew Paley",
                                           hjust = 1.5, x = 1, face = "italic", size = 10))
```
![all_features](https://github.com/matthewpaley/Spotify/blob/master/images/all_features.png)

Pretty cool! The biggest trends that jump out to me are an increase in danceability and loudness, and a decrease in acousticness. As someone who definitely prefers older music to newer music, I can't say I'm surprised by this.

## Step 5: Interactive Plot

One really cool thing we can do with the help of the `plotly` package is create an interactive plot, where we can actually hear a preview of the songs. First, I selected the 250 most popular songs from our tracklist, just so the plot doesn't become too overwhelmed with data points. 

```
# Select the 250 most popular songs in tracklist
top250 <- tlist %>% 
  arrange(-track.popularity) %>% 
  slice_head(n=250)
```

Next, I plotted the data with energy on the x-axis, and valence on the y-axis. These were variables found to have a moderate positive correlation in an earlier step. Also, I used the text aesthetic to create a text box that appears on hover. It shows the track name, artist, playlist name, and the length of the song in mm:ss formatting.

Lastly, we're depending on the `track.preview_url` for our song previews. Unfortunately, Spotify doesn't provide them for every song, so I noted in the text aesthetic whether or not the preview was available. See the plot [here] (https://rpubs.com/mjpaley10/spotify).

```
# Plot   
p <- ggplot(top250,  aes(energy, 
                         valence,
                         colour = pnum,
                         text = paste0("Song: ", track.name, 
                                       "\nArtist: ", artist,
                                       "\nPlaylist: ", playlist_name, 
                                       "\nLength: ", paste0(
                                         ifelse(floor(track.length) < 10,
                                                paste0("0",floor(track.length)),
                                                floor(track.length)), ":",
                                         ceiling(track.length[1] %% 1*60)),
                                       ifelse(is.na(track.preview_url),
                                              "\nPreview Unavailable",
                                              "\nClick for Preview")))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    title = "Data You Can Hear",
    subtitle = "Click a point to hear the song!") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p1 <- ggplotly(p, tooltip="text") %>%
  layout(title = list(text = paste0('Data You Can Hear',
                                    '<br>',
                                    '<sup>',
                                    'Click on a point to listen to a song preview!',
                                    '</sup>'),
         x = .47))

p1$x$data[[1]]$customdata <- top250$track.preview_url

p2 <- onRender(p1, "
               function(el, x) {
               el.on('plotly_click', function(d) {
               var url = d.points[0].customdata;
               //url
               window.open(url);
               });
               }
               ")
```
